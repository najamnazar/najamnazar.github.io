#  **Feature-based software design pattern detection**


A feature beased design pattern summarisation system that parses the Java based corpus using [JavaParser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser) and the code features provided creating a JSON representation. The identified pattern is added into the JSON representation and the natural language summaries are generated using [SimpleNLG](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg) tool. The main idea is that summary must capture the context in which the java file is used.

The tool code is accessible at [**https://github.com/najamnazar/designpatternsummariser**](https://github.com/najamnazar/designpatternsummariser).
