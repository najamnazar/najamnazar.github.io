In my current (remote) role as a **Lecturer (Education Specialist - Level B, equivalent to Assistant Professor in the North American System)** at the [School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences](https://set.adelaide.edu.au/computer-and-mathematical-sciences/) at the University of Adelaide, I am engaged in reviewing and enhancing course materials in the Data Science discipline. Previously, as a **Lecturer (Teaching Specialist)** at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne, I contributed to curriculum development, subject coordination, lecturing, tutoring, exam preparation, marking, and research within Software Engineering and Programming courses. I hold a **Professional Scrum Master I (PSM-I)** certification, reflecting my dedication to continuous professional development and adherence to industry best practices. I also bring extensive teaching experience from over six years as a sessional lecturer at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/it) and as a TAFE instructor at [Victoria University](https://www.vu.edu.au/study-at-vu/tafe) Australia. My research interests lie in Software Engineering and Generative AI.
