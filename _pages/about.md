I have recently joined Monash University’s Suzhou campus as a **Senior Lecturer (Level C)** in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence — equivalent to an Associate Professor in the North American academic system. In addition, I hold a concurrent appointment as a **Lecturer (Education Specialist - Level B)** in the [School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences](https://set.adelaide.edu.au/computer-and-mathematical-sciences/) at the University of Adelaide. In this remote role, I am responsible for reviewing and updating course materials within the Data Science discipline.

Previously, I served as an [Assistant Professor](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/schools/site/members/faculty/374-najam-nazar) in Software Engineering at the [School of IT and Engineering (SITE)](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/schools/site), ADA University, Azerbaijan, where I taught software engineering courses. Prior to that, I was a **Lecturer (Teaching Specialist)** at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne, where I contributed to curriculum development, subject coordination, and the delivery of lectures and tutorials. My responsibilities also included assessment and exam design, marking, and conducting self-directed research in Software Engineering.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a Teaching Academic and Sessional Lecturer at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/it) and as a TAFE Instructor at [Victoria University](https://www.vu.edu.au/study-at-vu/tafe), Australia.

I also hold a **Professional Scrum Master I (PSM-I)** certification, reflecting my commitment to continuous professional development and the integration of industry best practices in education.

My research interests focus on **Mining Software Repositories (MSR)**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Science Education**.
